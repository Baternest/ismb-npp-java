**The First Open Source bi-directional implementation of NPP communication between ACR122 and NEXUS-S.**

This project is a Java library to facilitate communication over NPP (NDEF Push Protocol) using ACS ACR-122 NFC terminals and Android Samsung Nexus S (NFC capable phone).  This project provides a library, running in Java SE, and an example code running on Android.

This library has been tested on Mac OS and Windows 7.

**2011-09-06** : In Downloads it has been uploaded JAVA code (http://ismb-npp-java.googlecode.com/files/NppFromReaderToPhone.zip) to send NDEF messages from ACR-122 to Android Samsung NEXUS-S phone and in http://code.google.com/p/ismb-npp-java/wiki/NppFromACR122ToPhone a short guide to do so.

**2011-09-07** : In Downloads it has been uploaded JAVA code (http://ismb-npp-java.googlecode.com/files/NPPFromPhoneToReader.zip) to receive NDEF messages (using an ACR-122 NFC reader)

In Downloads it has been uploaded also the Android code (http://ismb-npp-java.googlecode.com/files/AndroidSimpleNDEFPusherSource.zip) and also the installer (http://ismb-npp-java.googlecode.com/files/AndroidSimpleNDEFPusherAPK.zip) to send NDEF data from an Android Samsung NEXUS-S phone to an ACR-122 NFC reader.

Also a simple guide to do so has been uploaded in http://code.google.com/p/ismb-npp-java/wiki/NppFromPhoneToACR122.

**2011-09-26** : In Wiki section I've updated the two guides:
http://code.google.com/p/ismb-npp-java/wiki/NppFromACR122ToPhone
http://code.google.com/p/ismb-npp-java/wiki/NppFromPhoneToACR122
with different firmware behaviours

**2012-05-02** : Today I've implemented the SNEP protocol, writing the code useful to send data from reader to smartphone (I've tested the code using a Samsung Galaxy Nexus device with Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS).
In the following days I'll create a new google code site and I'll upload the code and a wiki.
